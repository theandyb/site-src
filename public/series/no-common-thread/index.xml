      <description>Welcome to my blog! Not sure exactly what&amp;rsquo;ll end up comprising the content of this section of my personal webpage, but I imagine that posts will cover topics that I am interested in. This could very well include statistics, population and medical genetics, running, and perhaps even some hot takes on pop culture (unlikely, but never say never!)
So buckle up, and get ready to enjoy the ride! (Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath waiting on new posts though)</description>
