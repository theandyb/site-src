      <description>This past fall I had the opportunity to take BIOSTAT880: Statistical Analysis with Missing Data. Although the course did cover a broad overview of different approaches to missing data analysis, we spent a decent amount of time covering various semiparametric approaches, from inverse probability weighting (IPW) and augmented IPW approaches to calibration-based approaches. This wasn’t my first taste of semiparametric inference, but it wasn’t a topic I felt entirely comfortable with, so for the term project I did for the course I choose to do a review of semiparametric approaches to the analysis of data from two-stage designs with a focus on applications to two-stage designs in genetics.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! Not sure exactly what&amp;rsquo;ll end up comprising the content of this section of my personal webpage, but I imagine that posts will cover topics that I am interested in. This could very well include statistics, population and medical genetics, running, and perhaps even some hot takes on pop culture (unlikely, but never say never!)
So buckle up, and get ready to enjoy the ride! (Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath waiting on new posts though)</description>
