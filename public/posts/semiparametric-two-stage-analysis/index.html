<p>This past fall I had the opportunity to take <a href="https://sph.umich.edu/academics/courses/course.php?courseID=BIOSTAT880">BIOSTAT880</a>: Statistical Analysis with Missing Data. Although the course did cover a broad overview of different approaches to missing data analysis, we spent a decent amount of time covering various semiparametric approaches, from inverse probability weighting (IPW) and augmented IPW approaches to <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.7547&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">calibration-based approaches</a>. This wasn&rsquo;t my first taste of semiparametric inference, but it wasn&rsquo;t a topic I felt entirely comfortable with, so for the term project I did for the course I choose to do a review of semiparametric approaches to the analysis of data from two-stage designs with a focus on applications to two-stage designs in genetics. I found the papers I read on the topic were incredibly interesting, so I figured that along with the term paper I&rsquo;d also write a series blog post that covers the material in a more informal matter. First I&rsquo;ll cover two-stage designs, with a particular emphasis on two-stage outcome-dependent designs.</p>

<h1 id="two-stage-designs">Two-stage designs</h1>

<p>In a two-stage design, there is a first phase in which a sample is drawn from a population of interest, and then a smaller subsample is then sampled from this sample for further analysis in the second phase of a study. This is generally done when a measure of interest is expensive to acquire and there are cheaper/easier to acquire measures that are correlated with the expensive variable. @neyman1938 considered the situation where the outcome of interest was expensive to acquire (due to a long interview), but there were other variables that were both easier to acquire for a larger sample and were correlated with the outcome of interest. Here one strategy would be to collect information on the cheap covariates for a large sample and then do stratified sampling on this sample to chose who to measure the outcome on. He explored examples where this double sampling approach could be either helpful or not in terms of efficiency (as opposed to doing one simple random sample to measure the outcome), which depends on prior knowledge on the relationship between the covariates in the population.</p>

<h1 id="two-stage-outcome-dependent-designs">Two-stage outcome dependent designs</h1>

<p>Sometimes the outcome of interest is easy to acquire, but it is postulated that there is a relationship between the outcome and a set of covariates that is expensive to acquire. To tie all of this to genetics, we can easily think of settings where we might have trait or disease measures on a large population that we think might have a genetic component, but it infeasible to genotype every subject. @white1982 introduced the idea of a two-stage outcome-dependent design thrugh the example of a rare-exposure/rare-disease study. In order to get reasonable estimates of risk in this scenarios, a simple random sample from a population would have to be rather large in order to sample both enough cases and exposed individuals. @white1982 proposed a two-stage approach in which during the first stage data are collected on exposure and disease status from a large sample. This sample can be presented in a 2x2 table as such:</p>

<p><center></p>

<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">Disease</th>

<td align="center">Y</td>
<td align="center">$N_1$</td>
<td align="center">$N_2$</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"></td>
<td align="center">N</td>
<td align="center">$N_3$</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
