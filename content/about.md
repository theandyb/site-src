Andy is a PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) [School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/). He is also a GSRA working with professors [Jun Li](https://www.junzli.com/) and [Sebastian ZÃ¶llner](http://csg.sph.umich.edu//szoellner/index.html) on questions arising at the intersection of population genetics and genomics. In particular, they are interested in modeling and understanding the consequences of variation in the germline mutation rate across the genome.

When he's not dredging through data or debugging code, Andy enjoys [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25469722/training/log), reading (things other than papers and textbooks), and playing with dogs (and sociable cats).
