Andy Beck is a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the University of Michigan. Working with Professors [Jun Z. Li](https://www.junzli.com/) and [Sebastian ZÃ¶llner](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/szoellner/), Andy's research interests lie in the field of statistical genetics/genomics. In particular, when considering sequencing data from large cohorts:

1. What inferences can we make regarding the influence of evolutionary forces over the course of human history based on the patterns of variation we see in modern day samples?
2. How can we characterize rates of mutation based on genomic and epigenomic features?
3. How can we link fine-grain mutation rates to disease risk, especially in regards to conditions linked to a high burden of *de novo* variants?

Andy originally hails from the Village of Germantown, WI, where he graduated from Germantown High School. He then attended Loyola University Chicago, where he earned a bachelor's in mathematics (2013) and a MS in appiled statistics (2-14). He then earned a masters in biostatistics at the University of Michigan (2016), where he worked with Professors Laura Scott and Stephen Parker to study gene expression changes brought on by type 2 diabetes. After a breif stint as a software developer in Verona, WI, Andy returned to Michigan in the fall of 2018 to begin his PhD studies. 

Andy also has a life outside of school/work. He loves to run, and as of writing he has completed 10 marathons (although his favorite distance to race is the 8km). He also enjoys writing sketch comedy and performing improv. His favorite food is pad thai, and if you ask nicely he'll give you his very opinionated ranking of the Thai restaurants in or near the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago (as of 2014).
